# Task Completion Summary

## Session Date
October 26, 2025

## Goals Achieved
1. ✅ Set up automated GitHub Actions workflow for multi-arch Docker builds
2. ✅ Configured GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) for image hosting
3. ✅ Restructured repository for Home Assistant add-on distribution
4. ✅ Fixed multiple runtime configuration issues
5. ✅ Resolved network binding and port accessibility
6. ✅ Fixed health check (watchdog) configuration
7. ✅ Added all required configuration files (arm.yaml, abcde.conf, apprise.yaml)

## Version History
- v0.1.0: Initial release with basic structure
- v0.1.1: Fixed Python execution in run.sh
- v0.1.2: Added apprise.yaml configuration support
- v0.1.3: Proper apprise.yaml with all notification services
- v0.1.4: Added watchdog health check, changed startup type
- v0.1.5: Changed external port from 8080 to 8089
- v0.1.6: Fixed watchdog to use internal port
- v0.1.7: Fixed watchdog format for HA Supervisor validation
- v0.1.8: Fixed watchdog port reference syntax
- v0.1.9: **Current** - Fixed network binding (0.0.0.0) and watchdog URL

## Key Issues Resolved

### 1. Python Script Execution
- **Problem**: Shell trying to execute .py file directly
- **Solution**: Changed `exec /opt/arm/arm/runui.py` to `exec python3 /opt/arm/arm/runui.py`

### 2. Missing Configuration Files
- **Problem**: ARM looking for apprise.yaml that didn't exist
- **Solution**: Created apprise.yaml with all notification service parameters, added copy logic to run.sh

### 3. Supervisor Timeout
- **Problem**: Add-on timing out after 120 seconds
- **Solution**: Changed startup type to `application`, added proper watchdog health check

### 4. Port Conflicts
- **Problem**: Port 8080 widely used, causing conflicts
- **Solution**: Changed external port to 8089

### 5. Network Accessibility
- **Problem**: Service accessible inside container but not from host
- **Solution**: Changed `WEBSERVER_IP` from `x.x.x.x` to `0.0.0.0` in arm.yaml defaults

### 6. Health Check Issues
- **Problem**: Watchdog checking wrong port, invalid format errors
- **Solution**: Used correct format `http://[HOST]:8089` matching HA documentation

## Current State
- **Version**: 0.1.9
- **Build Status**: GitHub Actions building multi-arch images
- **Deployment**: Images available at ghcr.io/mliradelc/arm-hass-addon:0.1.9
- **Repository**: Properly structured as HA add-on repository
- **Configuration**: All required files present and properly configured
- **Network**: Service listening on 0.0.0.0:8089, exposed on port 8089

## Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Test v0.1.9 once build completes
- [ ] Verify web UI accessible from Home Assistant IP:8089
- [ ] Confirm health check passes and add-on starts without timeout
- [ ] Test optical drive detection and ripping functionality
- [ ] Document configuration options in DOCS.md
- [ ] Add screenshots to README.md

## Next Steps
1. Wait for v0.1.9 build to complete on GitHub Actions
2. Update add-on in Home Assistant to version 0.1.9
3. Verify service starts without errors
4. Test web UI accessibility: `http://[HA-IP]:8089`
5. Monitor logs for any remaining issues
6. Begin functional testing with optical media

## Lessons Learned
1. Home Assistant watchdog format is strict - must use `[HOST]` placeholder
2. Services must bind to 0.0.0.0 for external accessibility in containers
3. Port references in watchdog use external port number, not internal
4. Python scripts need explicit interpreter when using exec
5. ARM application requires specific config file locations (/etc/arm/config/)
6. GitHub Actions can automate version-tagged releases effectively
